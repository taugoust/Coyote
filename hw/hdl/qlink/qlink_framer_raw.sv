/**
 * QLINK framer — RAW mode
 *
 * Replaces qlink_framer. The GT no longer does 8B/10B or gearboxing, which is
 * the entire point: measured on hardware, the PCS was 23.8 ns of a 31.8 ns
 * transceiver, against 8.0 ns for the PMA.
 *
 * Three jobs the PCS used to do now live here:
 *   WORD ALIGNMENT   pulse rxslide until the received word matches W_ALIGN
 *   DC BALANCE       scramble everything except ALIGN itself
 *   FRAMING          ALIGN when idle; a frame is the first non-ALIGN word
 *
 * WIRE PROTOCOL
 *   idle    ALIGN ALIGN ALIGN ...        unscrambled
 *   frame   HDR PAY..PAY TRAILER         scrambled
 * Word count is identical to the 8B/10B version, so framing adds no latency.
 * Frame length comes from HDR, so a payload word that happens to scramble to
 * ALIGN is harmless -- it is just payload. The only hazard is HDR itself
 * scrambling to ALIGN, which loses one frame with probability 2^-32: about one
 * round per 72 minutes at a 1 us cadence, and it is counted as a gap.
 *
 * TWO CLOCK DOMAINS, as before: TX on the local transmit clock, RX on the
 * recovered clock, sharing no state.

    // frame (trailer word immediately followed by the next header, no idle

    // sof and is silently dropped by that if/else-if -- confirmed by
    // deliberately trying it: tb_qlink's back-to-back-frames test broke.
    //
    // The actual fix is a closed-form, zero-extra-hop equivalent for des_out
    // itself, derived from qlink_scrambler's own structure. Inside its loop,
    // at iteration i the feedback bit read is s[57] ^ s[38] using s AS OF i
    // prior shifts; since positions 57 and 38 are both >= 31 they are NEVER
    // among the low bits a 32-bit word's worth of shifting touches, so at

    // ALWAYS, for any state_in, regardless of d_in or INVERT (INVERT only
    // selects what gets shifted IN afterward, which this never reads). So

    // state_in[38-i]) for every bit i -- an XOR with a mask that depends on
    // state_in ALONE. des_state is a plain register (zero-hop, exactly as
    // fast as rx_is_align/rx_state), so this mask, and hence this whole
    // expression, needs no wait on u_des's own process to react to the
    // current gt_rxdata. It is not an approximation valid only near '1 (that
    // was an earlier, narrower version of this fix) -- it is the exact same
    // function qlink_scrambler computes, for every state, every word, every
    // rx_state. u_des itself is still instantiated and still does the real
    // work this framer actually depends on: advancing des_state/des_state_n
    // for the next word, which DOES need the full bit-by-bit chain.

    // Deliberately ONE always_comb, not a mask signal computed by one block
    // and XORed with gt_rxdata by a second (assign) statement -- the same
    // reasoning as tx_word_fast above applies here too, and for the same
    // reason it mattered there: des_state genuinely changes at the last
    // R_PAY cycle -> R_TRAIL edge (advancing through the payload), so a
    // split mask/XOR pair would still cost an extra hop for the trailer
    // specifically, even though the header (where des_state sits unchanging
    // at '1 through idle) would not have shown it.
