/**
 * qlink_cdc_event unit test
 *
 * This module is the one piece of Task 2b that neither tb_qlink nor
 * tb_qlink_sys touches, and it is also the one whose failure mode is silent:
 * a torn wide transfer produces a payload that is half of one round and half of
 * the next, carried by a perfectly well-formed valid pulse. The checksum was
 * computed on the far side of the crossing, so nothing downstream can catch it.
 *
 * Clocked at the pair that is actually ON THE LATENCY PATH: the echo crossing,
 * qlink_rx_clk -> qlink_tx_clk, both 390.625 MHz at 15.625 Gbps. They are the
 * same nominal frequency but different oscillators (rx is recovered from the
 * far card), so they are modelled as independent clocks that drift against each
 * other for the whole run -- the accept and delivery edges land in every
 * relative phase rather than one convenient alignment.
 *
 * The other users of this module cross into aclk, which is off the critical
 * path: they only affect how quickly the host sees a status register.
 *
 * WIDTH is 1012 -- the actual echo-path width, which is also the widest
 * xpm_cdc_handshake this design can legally instantiate.
 *
 * The contract under test:
 *   1. Every value the crossing ACCEPTS is delivered exactly once, unmodified,
 *      and in order.
 *   2. Values offered while busy are dropped, never queued, never torn.
 *   3. src_accept genuinely marks the latching cycle, so a caller that holds
 *      src_valid until src_accept can never lose an update.
