/**
 * qlink_framer_raw: alignment and frame round-trip.
 *
 * The wire is modelled as a barrel shifter whose offset is set per test, and
 * rxslide DECREMENTS that offset by one -- which is what the GT's PCS slide
 * actually does. Starting at every one of the 32 offsets proves the aligner
 * converges regardless of where the deserialiser happens to land at power-on.
 *
 * An aligner that works from offset 0 and nowhere else passes a naive test and
 * fails on hardware every time but one in 32.

    // NEWER word's high bits, i.e. {prev[k-1:0], a_tx[31:k]}.

    // It is harmless in THIS testbench only because of two facts that live
    // outside this expression, not because the expression itself is
    // correct in general:
    //   1. Throughout the whole alignment hunt (Test 1) TX transmits a
    //      constant W_ALIGN every cycle -- qlink_framer_raw drives
    //      gt_txdata = W_ALIGN unconditionally in T_IDLE, and phy_tx_valid
    //      is never asserted until after lock -- so prev == a_tx always.
    //      Any phase-shifted sample of a CONSTANT-word stream is a true
    //      cyclic rotation of that one word regardless of which operand
    //      supplies the high bits vs the low bits.
    //   2. Lock is only ever declared at offset == 0, which bypasses this
    //      expression entirely (b_rx = a_tx, the explicit special case
    //      below) -- so the framer's pass/fail verdict never depends on
    //      this rotated expression being right, only on the offset==0 case.
    //
    // If TX's idle output is ever made non-constant, or if this wire model
    // is reused to inject bit errors into live, varying frame data at a
    // nonzero offset, this operand order becomes wrong and must be rewritten
    // as {prev[k-1:0], a_tx[31:k]} (with k = offset, and offset==0 handled
    // separately as today since shifting a 32-bit value by 32 is not a no-op
    // in Verilog).

    // rxslide shifts the recovered word boundary by one bit.
    //
    // ADJUSTMENT: `offset` has exactly ONE procedural writer -- this block.
    // The brief's original code assigned `offset` from two places: a
    // blocking assignment in the stimulus `initial` block (`offset = off;`,
    // to set up each of the 32 starting offsets) and a nonblocking
    // assignment here (originally `always_ff`) that advances it on `slide`.
    // `xelab` rejected that outright at elaboration (SV LRM 9.2.2.4: a
    // variable written by an always_ff block must not be written by any
    // other procedural block -- "invalid combination of procedural
    // drivers", a hard error, not a lint warning).
    //
    // Downgrading that block from `always_ff` to plain `always` made it
    // elaborate, but two writers of the same variable is a race pattern by
    // construction, not something that becomes safe just because the
    // keyword changed. It was safe only because THIS stimulus sequencing
    // temporally partitions the two writers -- the initial block touches
    // `offset` solely while rstn=0, and the DUT holds rxslide low under
    // reset so this block cannot fire in that window. That safety is an
    // accident of sequencing, not a property of the code, and a later edit
    // to the stimulus could silently reintroduce a real race in the one
    // testbench that decides whether the aligner converges at all.
    //
    // Fixed properly: `offset` is now driven by this single clocked block
    // only. The stimulus requests a starting value via `offset_load`/
    // `offset_load_en` (a plain combinational request, not a write to
    // `offset` itself); this block is the sole arbiter between "load a new
    // starting offset" and "advance by one slide."
    // ONE SLIDE PER PULSE, NOT PER CYCLE. UG578 requires RXSLIDE to be held for
    // a minimum of TWO RXUSRCLK2 cycles and then deasserted for more than 32
    // before it can be reasserted; each such pulse moves the boundary by
    // exactly one bit. Modelling this level-sensitively (slide on every cycle
    // the signal is high) silently assumed a one-cycle pulse: the moment the
    // DUT was corrected to hold rxslide for the required two cycles, the model
    // stepped TWO bits per pulse, so only even offsets were reachable and
    // exactly 16 of the 32 starting offsets could never lock. That is a defect
    // in this model, not in the DUT -- and it would have read as the opposite.
