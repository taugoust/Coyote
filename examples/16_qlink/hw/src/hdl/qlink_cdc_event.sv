/**
 * QLINK event-with-payload clock crossing
 *
 * Carries one value across a clock boundary atomically, on demand. Wraps
 * xpm_cdc_handshake with the four-phase source-side sequencing that macro
 * requires, so call sites stay readable.
 *
 * WHY NOT SOMETHING SIMPLER
 *
 * The obvious shortcut -- xpm_cdc_array_single on the data plus xpm_cdc_pulse on
 * the valid -- is WRONG here and looks right in simulation. Both paths have the
 * same number of destination flops, so the data is still resolving from its own
 * metastability on the cycle the pulse arrives, and individual bits can land on
 * either side. The result is a torn word: a payload that is half of round N and
 * half of round N+1, with a perfectly valid-looking valid pulse on it. Nothing
 * in the protocol above can detect that, because the checksum is recomputed on
 * the far side of the crossing.
 *
 * xpm_cdc_handshake holds the source data stable until the destination has
 * captured it, which is what makes the transfer atomic.
 *
 * DROP-DON'T-QUEUE, same as the rest of QLINK: a request arriving while a
 * transfer is in flight is discarded and src_busy is asserted so the caller can
 * count it. A four-phase handshake costs roughly SRC_SYNC_FF + DEST_SYNC_FF
 * destination cycles per transfer, so the sustainable rate is well under one
 * transfer per ~10 cycles. Every QLINK user of this module is either
 * single-outstanding (the latency benchmark's echo) or a
 * latest-value-wins status register, so dropping is the correct policy rather
 * than a limitation to work around.
 *
 * dest_data is only meaningful on the cycle dest_valid is high. Capture it.
